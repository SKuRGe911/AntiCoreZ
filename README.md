# AntiCoreZ
A MiSTer core I wrote to write demos and stuff on

This is a pet project of mine. I wrote it to better understand how computers like the amiga were made. If it doesnt work forgive me cause I only have my own hardware to test it on.

To run this core copy the .rbt file into the fat dir on your MiSTer SD card using FTP and in the /games/ folder create a directory named ACoreZ .
in /media/fat/games/ACoreZ/ put the disk image and the boot rom in it.

I will make a library which you can link to for programming stuff and a Template visual studio solution so you have somewhere to start.

You will need the risc V tool chain to compile programs.

Remember this is a work in progress :)
